### Quiz 2

Consider the ALOHA protocol for MAC. Let a large population of nodes generate on average 20 frames/sec according to a Poisson distribution and assume that transmission of a frame takes 100 msec (frame time). Find the ratio of slotted over pure ALOHA throughputs under the given assumptions, i.e. Throughput (slotted)/ Throughput (pure) = ?

e^2 = 7.39
